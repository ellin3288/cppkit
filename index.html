<p>The main idea of cppkit is that we are willing to sacrifice a little performance to gain usability. The end result will be a library that won't work for those who need the utmost performance, but will be a joy to use for everyone else. cppkit is an opinionated library that won't be right for everyone, and we think that's perfectly OK.</p>

<h3>
<a name="the-cppkit-ecosystem" class="anchor" href="#the-cppkit-ecosystem"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The cppkit ecosystem</h3>

<p>cppkit aims to be the base library in an ecosystem of C++11 libraries and attempts to set some conventions to make downstream use of the ecosystem easier. First and foremost, cppkit and all downstream libs should use cmake.</p>

<ul>
<li>cppkit (and downstream libraries) will install their headers and libraries to a directory at the same level as the cppkit project called "devel_artifacts".</li>
<li>Headers for each library will go into their own subdirectory under "devel_artifacts/include". For example, a downstream library called "foo" would put it's headers in "devel_artifacts/include/foo".</li>
<li>Libraries for all downstream projects will install into "devel_artifacts/lib".</li>
<li>cppkit will install build support files into "devel_artifacts/build". Downstream projects should only have to define a few variables and then include the appropriate build support cmake file to get all of the default ecosystem behaviour.</li>
<li>By using the common build support files downstream libraries will automatically have "devel_artifacts/include" added to their compilers include search path. They will also have "devel_artifacts/lib" added to their library search path. Projects should include the headers of other projects like this: #include "cppkit/ck_dynamic_library.h"</li>
<li>Downstream libraries should define their own C++ namespace, and (unless they have VERY good reason not to) confine all of their symbols to their own namespace.</li>
</ul>
